# Alpine with a search

Like [Alpine](https://github.com/nuxt-themes/alpine) but **with a search** (and that make a big difference) ðŸª„.

Try it out: [alpine-with-search.esteban-soubiran.site](https://alpine-with-search.esteban-soubiran.site/)

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Edge Side Rendering

Can be deployed to Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions, AWS, and most Node-compatible environments.

Look at all [the available presets](https://nuxt.com/guide/deploy/presets).

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Static Generation

Use the `generate` command to build your application.

The HTML files will be generated in the .output/public directory and ready to be deployed to any static compatible hosting.

```bash
pnpm generate
```

## Preview build

You might want to preview the result of your build locally, to do so, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm preview
```
